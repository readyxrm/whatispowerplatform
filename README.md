# What is the Power Platform Anyway?
What is the Power Platform Anyway?  

Microsoft has radically changed the business application development story over the last couple of years.  These great innovations have unfortunately caused a lot of confusion for customers, consultants and even Microsoft employees!  This session pieces together the story of the Power Platform and answers many questions, Is Dynamics 365 part of the Power Platform or is the Power Platform part of Dynamics 365?  Isn't a Model Driven App just a CRM form?  When we will be able to get a CDS? (Whatever that is?)  What do you mean by Unified Client?  Isn't that just version 9?  This session will answer those questions!
